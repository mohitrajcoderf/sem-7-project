# YouTube Clipper

A SaaS tool that allows users to extract specific clips from YouTube videos by providing a URL and start/end timestamps. Clips are processed efficiently and downloaded directly to your computer. Open source for folks who can't afford it and know how code works!

---

## Features

- **Frontend:** NextJS + TailwindCSS (with Shadcn/UI)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) with Bun runtime
- **Video Processing:** Uses `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` for efficient, compatible video clipping
- **No cloud storage required:** Clips are downloaded directly to your device

---

## Prerequisites

You must have the following installed on your system:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/):** `bun` (v1.2.7 or later)
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):** `node` (v18+ recommended)
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):** (for some tooling, v10+)
- **[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp):** Command-line tool for downloading YouTube videos
- **[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/):** Command-line tool for video processing

### To check if you have these installed, run:

```sh
bun --version
node --version
npm --version
yt-dlp --version
ffmpeg -version
```

If any are missing, install them via your package manager (e.g., `brew install bun yt-dlp ffmpeg` on macOS).


## Getting Started

## Usage

1. Open the frontend in your browser (`http://localhost:3000`).
2. Enter a YouTube URL and the desired start/end timestamps (format: `HH:MM:SS`).
3. Click "Clip Video".
4. The processed clip will be downloaded directly to your computer as `clip.mp4`.

---

## Required System Packages

- **yt-dlp**: Used for partial YouTube downloads.
- **ffmpeg**: Used for video/audio processing and re-encoding.
- **bun**: Used as the JavaScript/TypeScript runtime for both backend and frontend.
- **node** and **npm**: For compatibility and tooling.

## Troubleshooting

- **yt-dlp or ffmpeg not found:**  
  Make sure both are installed and available in your system PATH.
- **Video fails to upload to Twitter:**  
  The backend re-encodes all clips for Twitter compatibility. If you still have issues, ensure your ffmpeg is up to date.
- **Port conflicts:**  
  Change the port in the backend or frontend config if needed.

## Development

- TypeScript is used throughout.
- Hot reload is NOT enabled.
- Linting is available via `bun run lint` in the frontend.
