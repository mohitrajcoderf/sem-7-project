## **1. Overview**

The goal is to build a SaaS tool that allows users to extract specifies clips from Youtube videos by simply providing a URL along with start and end timestamps. Rather than downloading the entire video (which can be inefficient and time-consuming), you'll use tools and techniques to download only the required segment and then process it further if needed.

## **2. Core Components**

Bun is the runtime for the frontend and backend.

### **Frontend**
- **Framework:** React
  - Provides a fast, responsive, and SEO-friendly user interface.
  - Manages user authentication, input forms (for YouTube URL and timestamps), and real-time status updates.
  - Uses Shadcn/UI for the frontend components.

### **Backend**
- **Framework:** Node.js with Express  
  - Handles API requests, manages business logic, and orchestrates video downloading and processing.
  - Works closely with a job queue to manage asynchronous tasks.

### **Video Processing**
- **Tools:** yt-dlp and FFmpeg  
  - **yt-dlp:** Used for video downloading. Instead of downloading the full video, it leverages the `--download-sections` flag to download just the necessary portion.
    - Example command:  
      ```bash
      yt-dlp --download-sections "*start-end" -f bestvideo+bestaudio "VIDEO_URL" -o output.mp4
      ```
  - **FFmpeg:** Further trims or processes the downloaded segment if needed.
    - Example command for precise clipping:  
      ```bash
      ffmpeg -i output.mp4 -ss START_TIME -to END_TIME -c:v copy -c:a copy final_clip.mp4
      ```
  - This combination ensures efficiency by reducing both download time and resource usage.

### **Storage**
- **Solution:** AWS S3 or Supabase Storage  
  - Stores the resulting video clips.
  - Provides scalable, cost-effective, and fast retrieval for end users.

### **Job Queue Management**
- **Tools:** BullMQ with Redis  
  - Manages video processing tasks asynchronously.
  - Ensures that heavy video processing jobs are offloaded and do not block the main API.
  - Provides mechanisms for retrying failed jobs and tracking job status.

### **Database**
- **Choice:** PostgreSQL  with Drizzle ORM
  - Stores user data, video request metadata, and job statuses.
  - Example schema includes:
    - **Users Table:** Stores user credentials and profile info.
    - **Videos Table:** Contains information about each YouTube video request, including URL and processing status.
    - **Clips Table:** Keeps records of individual clip requests, start/end timestamps, and storage paths for the processed video clips.

### **Authentication & Payments**
- **Authentication:** Better Auth  
  - Simplifies user sign-up/sign-in and session management.

### **Monitoring & Error Tracking**
- **Tool:** Sentry  
  - Monitors errors and performance, helping you quickly identify and resolve issues.

## **3. Detailed Workflow**

### **Step 1: User Interaction**
- **Input:** User logs in and inputs a YouTube URL along with desired start and end timestamps.
- **Frontend:** The UI collects this data and sends it to the backend via an API call.

### **Step 2: Video Downloading**
- **Efficient Download:** Instead of downloading the whole video, the backend calls `yt-dlp` with the `--download-sections` parameter to fetch only the necessary segment.
- **Partial Download Benefit:** This reduces download time, minimizes bandwidth usage, and improves overall user experience.

### **Step 3: Video Processing**
- **Optional Trimming:** If further processing is required (e.g., ensuring frame accuracy or applying additional transformations), FFmpeg is used to process the downloaded segment.
- **Processing Modes:**
  - **Direct Clip:** When the downloaded segment exactly matches the userâ€™s timestamps.
  - **Post-Processing:** When additional trimming or encoding is needed to ensure compatibility or quality.

### **Step 4: Storage & Delivery**
- **Upload:** The processed clip is uploaded to AWS S3 or a similar storage solution.
- **Link Generation:** The system generates a URL that the user can use to access or download the clip.

### **Step 5: Asynchronous Job Management**
- **Queue Integration:** Video processing tasks are offloaded to a job queue (BullMQ), ensuring the main server remains responsive.
- **User Notification:** The system updates the frontend about the job status so users can see progress and receive notifications upon completion.

## **4. Technical Considerations & Optimizations**

### **Partial Download Efficiency**
- **Challenge:** Downloading an entire video is wasteful, especially when only a small segment is needed.
- **Solution:** Using `yt-dlp` with the `--download-sections` option minimizes the data fetched, significantly speeding up the process and reducing resource consumption.

### **Scalability**
- **Backend Services:** By using Node.js and a decoupled job queue (BullMQ with Redis), you can scale processing independently.

### **User Experience**
- **Progress Feedback:** Real-time updates on processing status help maintain a positive user experience.
- **Error Handling:** Sentry integration ensures that any issues are logged and addressed promptly, keeping the system robust and reliable.
- **User Authentication:** Using Better Auth ensures secure session management.

### **Security & Payments**
- **User Authentication:** Using Better Auth ensures secure session management.
